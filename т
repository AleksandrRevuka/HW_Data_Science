Please note the following 11 warnings:

1 : The check: is the application running?
    Produced the following warning: Docker is not running

Is the Docker Desktop application running?

2 : The check: are WSL distros installed?
    Produced the following warning: WSL Distribution docker-desktop is missing

The Docker engine uses several WSL distributions. Therefore these must be installed.

3 : The check: are WSL distros installed?
    Produced the following warning: WSL Distribution docker-desktop is missing

The Docker engine uses several WSL distributions. Therefore these must be installed.

4 : The check: is the WSL 2 Linux filesystem corrupt?
    Produced the following warning: prereq failed: are WSL distros installed?

If the WSL 2 Linux filesystem is corrupt then Docker Desktop cannot start.
There is a known issue fixed in Windows Insider builds which can cause filesystem corruption, see:
https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5895 .

Try running "wsl --shutdown" to stop your WSL Virtual Machine. When it restarts it will
run a filesystem check and hopefully fix the problem.


5 : The check: are WSL distros installed?
    Produced the following warning: WSL Distribution docker-desktop is missing

The Docker engine uses several WSL distributions. Therefore these must be installed.

6 : The check: is the VM time synchronized?
    Produced the following warning: prereq failed: are WSL distros installed?

The VM time must be in sync with the host, otherwise Docker Desktop will not work correctly.

Ensure you are using a modern WSL 2 kernel (see "wsl --update"). If this problem persists,
try manually synchronizing the VM clock with "sudo hwclock -s".

7 : The check: can a VM be started?
    Produced the following warning: prereq failed: are WSL distros installed?

The Docker engine runs inside a Linux VM. Therefore we must be able to start Virtual Machines.

8 : The check: is the LinuxKit VM running?
    Produced the following warning: prereq failed: is the application running?

The Docker engine runs inside a Linux VM. Therefore the VM must be running.

9 : The check: is the Docker engine running?
    Produced the following warning: prereq failed: is the LinuxKit VM running?

The Docker engine manages all containers and images on the host. Check the dockerd.log to see why it failed to start.

10 : The check: does the Docker API work?
    Produced the following warning: prereq failed: is the Docker engine running?

If the Docker API is not available from the host then Docker Desktop will not work correctly.

11 : The check: do Docker networks overlap with host IPs?
    Produced the following warning: prereq failed: does the Docker API work?

If the subnet used by a Docker network overlaps with an IP used by the host, then containers
won't be able to contact the overlapping IP addresses.

Try configuring the IP address range used by networks: in your docker-compose.yml.
See https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#ipv4_address-ipv6_address


Please investigate the following 2 issues:

1 : The test: is the application running?
    Failed with: Docker is not running

Is the Docker Desktop application running?

2 : The test: are WSL distros installed?
    Failed with: WSL Distribution docker-desktop is missing

The Docker engine uses several WSL distributions. Therefore these must be installed.
